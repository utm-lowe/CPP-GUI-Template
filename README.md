# CPP-GUI-Starter-Template
This is template creates a C++ environment with a sane gitignore and a simple
virtual window manager environment.

It takes a few minutes for the intial container of a codespace, but aftewrads
launches pretty quickly. To connect to the destkop, open the "ports" section and
then open the "desktop" port (6080) either in another tab or using the simple web
browser. This uses NOVNC as the client, so it is fully contained in the web browser.
